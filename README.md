Asana Translate Chrome extension
================================

I asked ASANA team if they had planned to translate Asana into multiple languages.
Response was: not in roadmap. So I decided to create my own chrome extension to translate it.

Want your own language? You can help! Read below :)


How to install extension
------------------------

Choose your flavour:

**Easy as pie**

- Download from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mmmjfjdbamonmaajclfcpicaanaonlfc)

- Enjoy!

**Geek install**

- Download the github project or clone it.

- Go to your Google Chrome extensions page or enter **chrome://extensions** into chrome url bar

- Enable developer mode.

- Click on **Load uncompressed extension**.

- Navigate to downloaded folder and open it.

- Enjoy! But remember that the extension will not be automatically updated to the latest version.


Adding more languages
---------------------

You can add more languages and help the project.

- Edit/Add the language in [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/asana/)
- Then [open an issue](https://github.com/ajimix/asana-translate-chrome/issues/new) to get the language added.

**Or**

- Download the project and add a new file named messages.json under _locales/lang/
- You can use the spanish one as template.
- Finally make a pull request!


Known issues
------------

- Sometimes strings under task info are not translated at first but end up being translated after a second ajax call from Asana.
- Months are not translated [#16](https://github.com/ajimix/asana-translate-chrome/issues/16).
